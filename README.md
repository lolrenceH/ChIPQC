# ChIPQC

This is a fork of ChIPQC in bioconductor. I need to fix a bug in QCmetrics(ChIPQCsample) which will cause the error: "names' attribute [9] must be the same length as the vector [7]"

Installation
```
library(devtools)
install_github("lolrenceH/ChIPQC")
```
or
```
BiocManager::install('lolrenceH/ChIPQC')
```
